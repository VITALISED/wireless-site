       Introduction
   </h1>

   <p>
    This isn't a personal introduction or anything but rather a short guide to understanding what the hell I'm going to write about.
    Since I haven't actually written anything yet I don't <i>actually</i> know what I'll be doing, but from what I've been meaning to write about in the past
    it may involve any of the following. So if anything it's probably more of a guide for me.
   </p>

   <ul>
    <li>Software development embargoes. (as of writing this I'm working on a No Man's Sky SDK so that'll be fun)</li>
    <li>Looking into any random tech I get my hands on.</li>
    <li>Unhinged rants</li>
    <li>'Promotional' material on any cool services I make for the site</li>
    <li>Maybe some guides if I find something hard</li>
    <li>etc (I forgot)</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
    I 100% guarantee I will forget about this for some 6 month gap at some point but I'll try to write something a couple times a month.
